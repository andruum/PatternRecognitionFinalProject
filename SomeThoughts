TODO:

1)Make functions for visualization
Preprocessing
    2) projection in (x, y)
    3) Normalize
    4) delete isolated points (and group of points?)
Do normalization before, to solve a problem with different positions of digits.
Code the neutral netwoooooork
    5) make the coordinates into a matrix (number of points in each cell)
    6) train mlp
    7) test mlp


function to code
points_xy = data_normalize(2D_data)
Mat(hxw) = coord_to_img(width, height, Pointsxy)
weights(wxhx10) = mlp_train([]ImgMat, []digit)
outputs(10) = mlp_test(ImgMat, weights)
